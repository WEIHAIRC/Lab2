                    <p>I did not overcome procrastiation on that day. I finsihed and submitted Math 20E
                    Homework until 12 minutes before the deadline. That is a failure, and I should improve.<br>
                    
                    Since I am in GMT+8 time zone, the 11:59PM was actually afternoon of my local time.
                    Tonight, I went to my grandma's home and played with cats. <br>
                    
                    The black cat is named "Yuanyuan", which means "fate" in Chinese. It is apathetic: it will almost scratch any one who touches it
                    except for my grandma. 
                    The brown one is named "<b>Guaiguai</b>", which means "<strong>docile</strong>" in Chinese. It is friendly to anyone. Of course, the "meow" in the video is made by Guaiguai.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I just listed the things to finish for that day, but did not make a detailed plan, 
                    so I start my work in disorder. For example, since I did not make any plan about 
                    the time to take CSE101 or PHIL 28 Quiz, I finally performed multitask on the 
                    preparation of both 2 quizzes. That is bad.

                <h1 id="Apr11">Today (Apr 11 2021)</h1>
                <p> 
                    Today I need to submit CSE110 Lab 2. I did not start early on that assignment. 
                    I will pay for that: our group meeting is today 7-8PM, and there are also other 
                    assginments due soon. <br> 
        
                    Next time I should start earlier. By now, I have learned that I tend to work more effeciently
                    at the time earlier than deadline. I mean, if I wait until the last day to start my work,
                    I will be much stressful, and then I will work much less effeciently. <br>

                    I need to read Peter Singer's <i>Famine, Affluence, Morality </i> and <em> John Mill's Utilitarianism</em> in next week.
